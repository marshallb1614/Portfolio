<p>I am a Junior at Katherine Anne Porter School in Wimberley, Texas. 
    I am a hard worker, I work well in groups, and am a member of the
     National Honor Society at KAPS. I am enrolled in a coding class where I learned how
      to code this website, with Mr. Patrick Lisk.

    Texas State University and get my Masters in Music Theory.</p3>
