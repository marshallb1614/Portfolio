    <h3>Blog Post #1</h3>
    <p>The topic of this blog post will be bass. So, I started 
      playing bass because of a band called Primus. My dad introduced 
      me to them when I was very young and I kind of forgot about them 
      until about a year ago. So, back to bass. I got my first bass 
      in December of 2017, after I got out of the hospital from appendicitis, 
      I'll talk about that in a future blog post. So I got my first bass, it was 
      an Ibanez 5-string, I got a 5-string because of the low B string needed 
      to play a Primus song called "My Name Is Mud" which was my favorite 
      Primus song at the time. I started to learn a few scales on bass, a few chords, 
      and a few other songs. I quite enjoyed playing bass, because the strings 
      were bigger so they were easier to keep track of. The bass featured in "My Name Is Mud" 
      is a 6-string fretlesss bass made by the custom bass luthier, Carl Thompson. I did 
      not have anywhere close to enough money to afford those basses (they were all in the 
      $1000+ range). Along the way, I have experienced times where I got really frustrated 
      over something I could not do correctly, for example, triplets, or the right hand thumb 
      technique featured in "My Name Is Mud" which required you to perform a 16th note sextuplet 
      with both of your hands working together, that was a challenge, but I eventually got it, and 
      now it is second nature. I also got that specific bass because it was fairly cheap, at only 
      $200 something. So, my advice for any aspiring bass players out there, never give up, you will 
      get it eventually.

    <h4>Blog Post #2</h4>
    <p>
      The topic of this blog post will be my appendicitis. So, around Thanksgiving time 
      of 2017, I woke up not feeling very good, almost my whole abdomen hurt, but debilitatingly 
      bad, just uncomfortable. It started to feel better later in the day. However, the 
      next morning is when all hell broke loose, I could barely even walk, I did not sleep at all 
      that night. I tried to get up to use the restroom, but when I tried to go, I could not, my abdomen 
      was that inflamed. I got out of the restroom and just collapsed, I could not find a comfortable side 
      to lay on, it was all so painful. My mom called the emergency room to have me looked at, I got there 
      around 7:30 in the morning that day, they ran a few tests, did some scans, including a blood test and a urine test. 
      However, I could not urinate, so they had to use a catheter to get the urine sample. Ouch! That was probably the worst part 
      of that day, everything else was just being anesthetized and waking up in my hospital room. Easy peasy. I woke up 
      heavily bloated, because they type of appendectomy they did was called laporoscopic where they have to pump air into 
      me to do the surgery, they told me that would clear in a few days though. The other downside of all this was that 
      I was being pumped with antibiotics through an IV, so that was really messing with my body. So, I had to be put on a 
      liquid diet. About a week passed and I was being sent home, they told me that I might experience some vomiting and 
      other abdominal side effects. The day after I got home, I threw up. Ew! So, I went back to the hospital to tell them 
      what happened, and they did another scan and told me that I had about 3 abcesses (pockets of infectious fluid) in my 
      abdominal cavity. They told us that I would have to be sent to Dell Children's in Austin. It took a while to get there but 
      it was a nice ride. Once I got there, they set me up with a room and everything, it was pretty great. I got a cool male nurse 
      named Matt that helped me along the way. A couple days later, I had to get a PICC (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter) Line 
      inserted into the side of my left arm to pump antibiotics into me to clear the infection. I was released after a few days, and 
      that was the last hospital I went to that year.

    <h5>Blog Post #3</h5>
    <p>
      The topic of this blog post will be Driver's Ed. So, around October of 2018, I started Driver's Ed, I was already 16 though. 
      Usually, kids recieve their license on their 16th birthday, so I was already way behind. I had high hopes that it would go smoothly. 
      I did it online at driversed.com, it looked like a pretty nice website, pretty intuitive. It was $79 to buy the course, not too bad 
      when compared to other websites. I was informed that after the first 6 hours you would receive your learner's permit, pretty exciting 
      I did the first 6 hours and got my permit to start learning, thinking that I would come back in 6 months to take the test. 
      My mom would be my teacher, because Parent-Taught was cheaper. The first few weeks of driving, she was pretty readily available to go drive 
      on the weekend. But, as the course continued, she was less and less available. I mean, I understand that people can be busy sometimes, but 
      when a teenager like me is after his license, he won't let anything get in his way. December came along, we didn't get any of the 44 hours done, 
      at all. It was kind of a set back, but I wasn't going to give up. January came along, and we got some hours done here and there. I didn't get as 
      many hours as a I planned to the whole 6 month period. Now, we're in May and I'm still not done. I am 72% percent done with the online course, in 
      total, I need 32 hours. It is kind of frustrating at times, because I just want my license already.
